# [Project 1 : Early Stage Diabetes Prediction Model](https://github.com/Rizwal/Early-Stage-Diabetes-Prediction)
-To accurately predict early-stage diabetes by analyzing patient symptoms using machine learning models such as Catboost, random forest, logistic regression, and XGBoost out of which XGBoost achieved an impressive accuracy of around 99%.
-The results were then integrated into a web app using Pickle and Streamlit, providing a user-friendly platform for disease prediction.

# [Project 2 : Predictive Maintenance System](https://github.com/Rizwal/Predictive_Maintenance_Model)
-Implemented a Predictive Maintenance model leveraging Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVC, and ANN models to predictmachine failure based on parameters like torque, RPM etc. 
-Achieving an impressive 98.59% accuracy with 0.03 error, the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) stood out.
-Integrated results into a web app using Pickle and Streamlit for seamless predictions.

# [Project 3 : Movie Recommender System](https://github.com/Rizwal/Movie-Recommender-System)
-Implemented a movie recommender system using Kaggle's movie dataset, preprocessing data with Pandas and NumPy, and converting it to numerical vectors with sklearn. 
-Identified key movie tags using NLP techniques such as nltk and developed a similarity algorithm for personalized recommendations
