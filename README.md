* To accurately predict early-stage diabetes by analyzing patient symptoms using machine learning models such as Catboost, random forest, logistic regression, and XGBoost out of which XGBoost achieved an impressive accuracy of around 99%.
* The results were then integrated into a web app using Pickle and Streamlit, providing a user-friendly platform for disease prediction.
